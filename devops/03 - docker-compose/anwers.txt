1. What is the difference between Docker Compose and dockerfile? Why do I need Docker Compose?

Dockerfile can only configure one container. But applications need multiple processes, they cannot run in one container.
With docker compose, you can run many containers which need for your application.

2. How do I parameterize compose for different environments?

First of all you can set your environments in docker-compose file to set it in containers
or may create Dockerfiles where set needed environments and write ways to Dockerfiles


3. What types of entities are used in docker-compose and for what purpose?

* version - set version of docker compose specification
* services - set services and they configurations, you need in your environments for correct work your application
* networks - Each container for a service joins the default network and is both reachable by other containers on that network, and discoverable by them at a hostname identical to the container name.
* volumes - Set directory on server to mount in container

* How to output application logs?
docker-compose logs <name-of-service>
docker logs $cont_id
docker-compose up > log.txt
Or start without -d and see log on your screen

* How to copy\upload a file from host machine to the container?
    Use Docker cp SRC_PATH|- CONTAINER:DEST_PATH
    Or mount directory with file use volumes

* How to save file changes made inside the container?
    If volume mount, changes in directory which mount in container save automatically.
