What is Docker? Which technology is it based on?

Docker is a program for deploying applications in the environment necessary for him.
Docker works like vitraualization but with the condition of using the system core.
Docker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container.

Look at the Docker file â€“ what would you change in it?

1. Use version in FROM (and try to set not "latest")
2. set the ENV

How do I pass variables to the Docker file when building and running the container?

for example from task:
add ARG var_name and ENV HOST=$var_name in Dockerfile then build:
docker build --build-arg var_name=$(hostname -I | cut -f1 -d' ') (...)
to watch result, don't forget to add ports in docker run.
