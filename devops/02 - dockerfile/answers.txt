1. What is Docker? Which technology is it based on?

Docker is a program for deploying applications in the environment necessary for him.
Docker uses a technology called namespaces, cgroups & capabilities to provide the isolated workspace called the container.

2. Look at the Docker file â€“ what would you change in it?

  2.1. Use version in FROM (and try to set not "latest")
  2.2. Set the ENV
  2.3. Dont install openssh-server, apache2, supervisor
  2.4. EXPOSE isnt required parameter
  2.5. Use USER parameter for security
  2.6. Use alpine image for lightweight containers

3. How do I pass variables to the Docker file when building and running the container?

For example from task:
* add ARG var_name and ENV HOST=$var_name in Dockerfile then build:
  docker build --build-arg var_name=$(hostname -I | cut -f1 -d' ') (...)
  To watch result, don't forget to add ports in docker run.

* If you need to run container with specific env variables you can use -e parameter
